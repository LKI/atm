# ATM, Acfun TerMinal

This is a command line tool to enjoy [AcFun][1]

[AcFun][1] is an ACG website, well known for its otaku culture among Chinese.
AcFun users prefer to call themselves **Acer**, and they've create a lot of dank memes.

This project aims to provide a commandline tool for browsing [AcFun][1] on terminal.
~~Also for my own purpose, practice Java. Actually python should be the first choice.~~

# Project feature

Still at the very first stage, these are actually all TODOs.

* Direct shell command to get articles, and shell prompt

* Login/logout, multi-user support

* Read AcFun articles, filters

* I18N supported, at least Chinese and English (top two language)

* May be some reports, like "how many pages are deleted", "who is the charmest acer"...

* Should support at least these commands (get / list / login,logout / clear-cache / validate,help,info,todo,update / config,alias / report)

# Dependency and installation

Depends on Java 1.7 (Actually I want to depends on Java1.8)

Chrome. (Use selenium and chrome driver to get the page.)

**TODO: Here should be installation process for Windows and Unix**

# Contribution

Currently I don't need it. :smiling\_imp:
